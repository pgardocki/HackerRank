## Adding my solutions to HackerRank coding puzzles

If you're not familiar with www.hackerrank.com, it's this great website where you can solve programming puzzles of increasing complexity in different domains (algorithms, mathematics, data structures, databases, regex, etc...) and they have support for 30+ different programming languages. Each problem has multiple testcases that you need to pass, and you also need to find an efficient solution otherwise your program can timeout. All of my solutions are in Ruby and though some of my earlier solutions are not the best, there is quick improvement because after you solve a puzzle, you are allowed to view other user's solutions, and this helps you to learn a lot. For example, for puzzle #25 I was able to use recursion to determine if a number N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.
